## About the project

I like DIY and  I would like to build a tiny home under the Tiny home movement.
It is not so familiar in Hungary but I believe in it, and I hope I can create a 
Hungarian Tiny-home movement here.

I started a fundraising project for it because I grab every possibilities to get the money for this project. 
I would like to write down my future experiences in this site. I hope I can begin soon. :)
